# sudoku-cuckoo-search
 The code mimics the behavior of the Cuckoo Search algorithm to find a valid solution for the Sudoku puzzle.
The algorithm is inspired by the brood parasitism behavior of certain species of cuckoo birds.
## How it Works
- The algorithm searches for valid Sudoku solutions by treating each potential solution as a "nest."
- It evaluates the "fitness" of each solution and evolves the population of nests to find a correct solution.
